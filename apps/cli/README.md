# patchctl

For local PostgreSQL setup, see the [local CLI guide](../../docs/local-cli.md). The
[customer getting-started guide](../../docs/customer-getting-started.md) separately documents the
incomplete reviewed-patch migration and its explicit hosted compatibility path.

From the repository root:

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @corely/contracts build
pnpm --filter @corely/api-client build
pnpm --filter patchctl build
node apps/cli/dist/cli.js --help
```

The strict TypeScript source is `src/cli.ts`; `tsc` emits the Node.js executable to `dist/cli.js`.
Generated output is ignored by Git. The package declares the `patchctl` executable for
package-manager linking; no global installation is required.

## Local-first source commands

Customer Postgres credentials belong to the local CLI runtime. `connect` tests the database from
the user's machine, stores only a credential reference and non-secret source metadata in
`~/.patchctl/config.json`, and stores the DSN in the operating-system credential backend. The CLI
does not send that DSN to the PatchCTL HTTP service.

```text
patchctl connect postgres --tenant my-project
patchctl sources
patchctl init --resources public.articles --columns id,title
patchctl schema my-project
patchctl schema my-project articles
patchctl resources
patchctl list articles --limit 20
patchctl get articles 123
```

`PATCHCTL_DATABASE_URL` is an explicit process-only fallback for CI and disposable environments.
It takes precedence over the keyring and is never copied into PatchCTL config. Do not place it in
source control, command arguments, shell history, shared logs, or telemetry.

All successful output is JSON on stdout and structured errors are JSON on stderr. Connection and
credential failures use safe error messages and never include a password or complete DSN. This
boundary means PatchCTL does not expose or upload the credential; it cannot prevent an unrelated,
fully privileged process running as the same OS user from accessing machine-level secrets.

## Hosted compatibility commands

The portable `@corely/api-client/patchctl` remains credential-free and Postgres-free. The older
server-connected implementation is retained only behind the explicit `server` namespace while the
review/apply migration is incomplete:

```text
patchctl server sources
patchctl server schema SOURCE_ID
patchctl server read SOURCE_ID --file query.json
patchctl server validate --file proposal.json
patchctl server propose --file proposal.json
patchctl server status PATCH_ID
patchctl server history PATCH_ID
```

This compatibility server must separately enable `PATCHCTL_LEGACY_SERVER_CONTENT=1`; it owns its
own configured DSN and does not receive the local CLI credential. Set `PATCHCTL_URL` and
`PATCHCTL_TOKEN` only for these explicit hosted commands. The local demo helper exercises this
compatibility path with `pnpm local:agent server ...`.

Use `--stdin` instead of `--file` to pipe JSON. Compatibility validation checks local structural
constraints without a token or mutation. Submission performs authoritative server-side checks and
returns a human review URL. Neither local database access nor coding-agent autonomy grants content
approval authority: agents propose, humans approve.
